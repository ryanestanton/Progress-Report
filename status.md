#### What have you done for your project so far?

So far for our project, I have written all the necessary code for the main code to recognize and read our hand gestures and some ASL gestures. On my computer the code is a little ify and I am still having some problems, but Brennans works well and his was able to read some gestures from the data Andrew collected for the most part. I also have started looking into starting the UI for our project and getting that figured out. 

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to design and figure out the UI we will use for our code in the end. 

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I have had a lot of problems getting some of the needed programs on my computer and with my code not running because of errors from this, but I was able to fix it for the most part after changing the code a little and trying different things. Last week I was getting some more errors but I was able to fix almost all of them and I just have one more thing that is giving me issues.
